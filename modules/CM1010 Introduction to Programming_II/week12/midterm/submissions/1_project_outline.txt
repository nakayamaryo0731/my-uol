Template Selected: Data Visualisation App

I chose the Data Visualisation template because I am a runner who has been tracking running data with a Garmin watch for nearly 2 years. I am currently training for the Osaka Marathon in February 2025, and I wanted to visualise my personal data to monitor progress toward my goals. My training targets are running 100km per month and achieving a pace of 6:00 per kilometre.

My dataset contains 168 activity records exported from Garmin Connect, including fields such as date, distance, average pace, average heart rate, and activity type (Run, Trail Run, Hiking).

Extensions I am adding:

1. Monthly Distance - Bar chart displaying total distance per month. This helps track progress toward my 100km/month goal. The chart aggregates all activities by year-month and displays values with labels rotated for readability.

2. Pace Progress - Line chart showing how my running pace has changed over time. Includes a 10-run moving average trend line to smooth out day-to-day variation and visualise long-term improvement. Only runs of 3km or longer with reasonable pace values are included.

3. Activity Types - Pie chart showing the distribution of Run, Trail Run, and Hiking activities. A dropdown selector allows switching between viewing by count (number of activities) and by distance (total kilometres).

4. Heart Rate vs Pace - Scatter plot analysing the correlation between average heart rate and running pace. Features a linear regression trend line and interactive tooltips that display details when hovering over data points.

Complex coding techniques used:

- Constructor functions: Created two new reusable constructors (BarChart and ScatterPlot) following the same pattern as the provided PieChart
- Arrays of objects: Data aggregation, grouping by month, and sorting operations
- Nested loops: Monthly distance aggregation, filtering activities by type and distance
- Statistical calculations: Moving average algorithm, Pearson correlation coefficient, least squares linear regression

Expected challenges:

- Converting Japanese CSV column headers to English for easier coding
- Parsing pace data from "min:sec" string format to numerical values for calculations
- Implementing interactive tooltips that follow mouse position on scatter plot
- Handling edge cases such as missing heart rate data or unusually slow/fast pace values
