\section*{Set Operations Using the Listing Method}

Let the universal set be:
\[
U = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x < 20\} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 19\}
\]

Define the following subsets of \( U \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set \( A \) is the set of even numbers in \( U \):  
    \( A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18\} \)
    \item Set \( B \) is the set of odd numbers in \( U \):  
    \( B = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\} \)
\end{itemize}

Now we evaluate the following sets using the listing method:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \( A \cap \overline{B} \)  
    Since \( \overline{B} = U \setminus B = A \), we have:  
    \[
    A \cap \overline{B} = A \cap A = A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18\}
    \]

    \item \( \overline{A} \cap B \)  
    Since \( \overline{A} = U \setminus A = B \), we have:  
    \[
    \overline{A} \cap B = B \cap B = B = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\}
    \]

    \item \( A \cup B \)  
    Since \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint and together cover all of \( U \):  
    \[
    A \cup B = U = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\}
    \]

    \item \( A \oplus B \) (symmetric difference)  
    By definition, the symmetric difference is:  
    \[
    A \oplus B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)
    \]
    Since \( A \cap B = \emptyset \), we get:  
    \[
    A \oplus B = A \cup B = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
