\section*{Solution}

We are asked to find the number of positive integers not exceeding $2310$ that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes.

\subsection*{Step 1. Define sets}
Let 
\[
A = \{1,2,3,\dots,2310\}
\]
\[
A_1 = \{ x \in A \mid x \text{ is a perfect square} \}
\]
\[
A_2 = \{ x \in A \mid x \text{ is a perfect cube} \}
\]

We need to compute $|A_1 \cup A_2|$.

\subsection*{Step 2. Count $|A_1|$}
The largest perfect square not exceeding $2310$ is
\[
48^2 = 2304 \leq 2310 < 49^2 = 2401
\]
Thus,
\[
|A_1| = 48
\]

\subsection*{Step 3. Count $|A_2|$}
The largest perfect cube not exceeding $2310$ is
\[
13^3 = 2197 \leq 2310 < 14^3 = 2744
\]
Thus,
\[
|A_2| = 13
\]

\subsection*{Step 4. Count $|A_1 \cap A_2|$}
An integer that is both a square and a cube must be a sixth power. The largest sixth power not exceeding $2310$ is
\[
3^6 = 729 \leq 2310 < 4^6 = 4096
\]
Thus,
\[
|A_1 \cap A_2| = 3
\]

\subsection*{Step 5. Apply inclusion-exclusion}
\[
|A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2|
= 48 + 13 - 3 = 58
\]

\subsection*{Final Answer}
The number of positive integers not exceeding $2310$ that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes is:
\[
\boxed{58}
\]
